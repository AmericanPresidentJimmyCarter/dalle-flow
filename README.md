### Install

#### Clone repos

```bash
mkdir dalle && cd dalle
git clone https://github.com/hanxiao/dalle-flow.git
git clone https://github.com/JingyunLiang/SwinIR.git
git clone https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion.git
git clone https://github.com/Jack000/glid-3-xl.git
```

You should have the following folder structure:

```text

 |-- glid-3-xl/
 |-- latent-diffusion/
```

#### Install auxiliary repos

```bash
cd latent-diffusion && pip install -e . && cd -
cd glid-3-xl && pip install -e . && cd -
```

```bash
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/bert.pt
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/kl-f8.pt
wget https://dall-3.com/models/glid-3-xl/finetune.pt
```

#### Install flow

```bash
cd dalle-flow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the server

```bash
jina flow --uses flow.yml
```
